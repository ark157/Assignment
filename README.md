# Assignment
This repository contains example C++ programs demonstrating various fundamental concepts such as file handling, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, templates, operators, and more.

List of Programs and Concepts
1. Display Grade Using Nested If-Else
Program to display grade based on percentage using nested if-else statements.

2. Temperature Conversion Using Switch Case
Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit using switch-case.

3. Right-Angle Triangle Pattern Using Asterisks
Prints a right-angle triangle pattern with asterisks.

4. Display Multiplication Table Using Do-While Loop
Prints multiplication table of a user-entered number using a do-while loop.

5. Student Class with Private Members and Input Method
Implements a Student class with private members and a method to enter student details.

6. Calculate Gross Salary Using Classes and Scope Resolution Operator
Calculates employee's gross salary with member functions defined outside the class.

7. Array of Objects Example with Student Class
Demonstrates storing multiple student objects in an array, inputting and displaying their details.

8. Swap Numbers Using Call-by-Value
Attempts to swap two numbers using function call by value (does not swap actually).

9. Find Count and Sum of Integers Divisible by 9 Using Friend Function
Uses a friend function to find count and sum of numbers divisible by 9 in a given range.

10. Square and Cube Using Default Constructor
Uses a default constructor to calculate and display square and cube of a number.

Implements a Book class and uses a copy constructor to duplicate book objects.

13. Function Overloading for Area Calculations
Overloads methods to calculate area of rectangle, triangle, and surface area of a sphere.

14. Unary Operator Overloading
Demonstrates overloading unary minus operator in a custom class.

15. Simple Inheritance to Read and Print Student Information
Uses two classes with simple inheritance to manage and display student info.

16. Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance to Handle Employee Data
Shows examples of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance to read and print employee and manager details.

17. Function Overriding Example
Illustrates overriding a base class's method in a derived class.

18. Implementation of Virtual Function
Demonstrates runtime polymorphism using virtual functions and base class pointer.

19. File Handling - Writing to a File
Opens a file for writing and writes lines of text to it.

20. File Handling - Reading from a File
Opens a file for reading and prints its contents line by line.

21. Factorial Calculation with Multiple Exception Handling
Calculates factorial with exceptions for negative input and overflow, handled by multiple catch blocks.

22. Template Class Example
Illustrates a template class capable of handling operations on different data types like int and double.
